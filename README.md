## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the nutritional content of McDonald's menu items. 
The analysis aims to extract meaningful information from the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
create visualizations to present the nutritional facts, and identify healthy and less healthy menu options. 

## Objectives

- Extract meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the nutritional distribution and trends.
- Create visualizations to present the calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items.
- Identify healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content.

## Dataset

The dataset contains nutritional information for various McDonald's menu items. Key columns include:
- **Category**: Type of food item (e.g., Burger, Beverage, Dessert).
- **Item**: Name of the menu item.
- **Calories**: Calorie content of the item.
- **Total Fat (g)**: Total fat content in grams.
- **Protein (g)**: Protein content in grams.
- **Carbohydrates (g)**: Carbohydrate content in grams.
- **Sugars (g)**: Sugar content in grams.
- **Sodium (mg)**: Sodium content in milligrams.
- 
## Timeline

The project is expected to be completed within two weeks.

## Deliverables

   - Description of data analysis approach and methodology.
   - Exploratory data analysis findings and insights.
   - Visualizations depicting nutritional information.
     
 **Source code** used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
